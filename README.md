# BMI Prediction with ResNet50 and Auxiliary Features

This repository implements a PyTorch-based pipeline for predicting Body Mass Index (BMI) from images. By leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 model and enhancing it with an auxiliary sex feature in a custom regression layer, this project achieves a Pearson correlation of **0.665**—exceeding the baseline of 0.65.

## Key Features
- **Pretrained ResNet50 Backbone**  
  Utilizes transfer learning to extract high-level visual features for effective BMI estimation.
- **Custom Regression Layer**  
  Integrates an additional sex feature to boost prediction accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Data Augmentation & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  Applies various random transformations (e.g., resizing, cropping, color jittering) alongside a systematic grid search to optimize model performance.
- **Modular and Production-Ready Codebase**  
  Separates data preprocessing, model definition, training routines, and configuration for maintainability and scalability.
